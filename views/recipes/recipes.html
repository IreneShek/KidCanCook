                    <h4>Recipe Preparation</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer. Lower the heat so the stock stays hot
                            while you cook the risotto.</li>
                        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium
                            heat. When the
                        <li>butter has melted, add the chopped shallot or onion. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until
                            slightly translucent.</li>
                        <li></li>Add the rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that the grains are
                        coated with the oil and melted butter. Sauté for another minute or so, until there is a slightly
                        nutty aroma. But don't let the rice turn brown. </li>
                        <li>Add the vermouth or wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed.</li>
                        <li>Add a ladle of hot chicken stock to the rice and stir until the liquid is fully absorbed.
                            When the rice appears almost dry, add another ladle of stock and repeat the process. </li>
                        <li>Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for 20 to 30 minutes or until the grains are
                            tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy (al dente). </li>
                        <li>Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmesan cheese and parsley. Season to
                            taste with kosher salt.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Tips:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you add a ladle of broth or wine to the risotto, make sure that you wait until the
                            risotto has almost completely absorbed the liquid and the rice is nearly dry before you add
                            the next ladle.</li>
                        <li>It's important to stir constantly, especially while the hot stock gets absorbed, to prevent
                            scorching.</li>
                        <li>If you run out of stock and the risotto is still crunchy, finish cooking it with hot water.
                            Add the water a ladle at a time, stirring while it's absorbed.</li>
                            <Li>Can add can salmon, any sausage, chicken, ground pork or beef.</Li>
                            <li>Can add any vegetable or dry fruit like corn, carrot, peas, raisin, dry cranberries. </li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Melt butter in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add thyme, onion, and garlic. Cook until onion is
                    completely soft and translucent, 10–12 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; add tomato paste. Continue
                    cooking, stirring often, until paste has begun to caramelize in spots, 5–6 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Add tomatoes with juices, 1 tsp. sugar, and 8 cups water to pot. Increase heat to high; bring to a
                    simmer. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer until flavors meld and soup reduces to about 2 quarts (8 cups),
                    45–55 minutes. Remove soup from heat; let cool slightly. Discard thyme sprigs. Working in small batches,
                    purée soup in a blender until smooth. Return to pot.<br>
                    <mark>DO AHEAD:</mark> Soup can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool slightly, cover, and chill. Rewarm before
                    continuing.

                  <li>Stir in ¼ cup cream. Simmer soup until flavors meld, 10–15 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt,
                    pepper, and remaining 1 tsp. sugar. Add more cream, if desired.</li>
